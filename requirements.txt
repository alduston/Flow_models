# ============================================================
# Requirements for lsi_cotrain / batch_norm_lsi + eval scripts
# (MNIST/FMNIST/EMNIST/KMNIST + FID/KID/LPIPS optional metrics)
# ============================================================

# --- Core scientific computing ---
numpy>=1.21
scipy>=1.7
pandas>=1.3

# --- Progress / UX ---
tqdm>=4.60

# --- Plotting ---
matplotlib>=3.5

# --- PyTorch stack ---
# NOTE: On clusters (e.g., Frontera) it's often best to install torch/torchvision
# from the official PyTorch CUDA wheel index instead of plain PyPI.
torch>=1.12
torchvision>=0.13

# TorchVision commonly uses PIL images; Pillow is a typical requirement for image I/O.
pillow>=9.0

# --- Optional: perceptual similarity (your try/except import lpips) ---
lpips==0.1.4

# --- Optional: FID/KID via torchmetrics (your try/except import torchmetrics.image.fid) ---
# Using torchmetrics' default FID feature extractor requires torch-fidelity.
torchmetrics[image]>=1.0
torch-fidelity>=0.3.0

# --- Optional: GPU array acceleration (only if you actually use CuPy code paths) ---
# Choose ONE that matches the CUDA toolkit on the node.
# cupy-cuda12x>=13.0   # for CUDA 12.x
# cupy-cuda11x>=12.0   # for CUDA 11.x
